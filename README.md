# Refactor of Horiseon Webpage

## Description of changes

### HTML Changes: 
    
    * Added alt attributes to all images for accesibility.
    * Added missing ID to HTML elements to fix broken links.
    * Added anchor to "Horiseon" in header to link to index.html (Homepage) Reasoning: 
        This is a preparatory setup step to allow any future pages to link back to the homepage.
    * Changed title of Webpage to "Horiseon".
    * Cleaned up HTML syntax by fixing indentation and adding line space between sections.
    * Replaced <div> elements with the appropriate semantic HTML elements such as <header>, <footer>, <section>, and <article>.
    
###  Consolidated CSS classes and selectors:
    * A review of the style sheet found that there were a number of classes that essentially dictated the same exact style. Such classes were replaced by a singular class along with the corresponding html element's class.
